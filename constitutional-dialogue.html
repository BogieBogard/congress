                                    <p>The following is an essay for my class The American Presidency. The paper compares and contrasts the views of the Federalists and Anti-Federalists regarding the Constitution and executive power.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Embedded in the Constitution was a design whose purpose was to fundamentally change American society. It set out to transform the new nation from a primarily agrarian country to a more developed, industrial, and prosperous one. And would accomplish this with increased power of the executive branch, which could see and act on opportunities to shape the United States in that image. It’s important that the authority rest with the President as the people can’t convert their society nearly as effectively because they require deliberation and act too slowly.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Conflict between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists arose from this constitutional design. Both sides understood the likely possibility of the nation growing and urbanizing because of the document. But the Federalists favored the Constitution while the Anti-Federalists denied it. The two also recognized that the Constitution created a robust executive. With the authority of being the Commander in Chief, filling vacancies, and issuing treaties, there was no rejecting that this President would be an energetic head of state. And because the strong Presidency plays such a vital role in instituting this future, much of their debate focused on the executive.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>On the topic of duration of the Presidency the Anti-Federalists view a four-year term as too long, citing that such an extended period of time would give the President ample time to ruin the country. It would inflict great harm on the country because they view power that is independent from the people as a force for abuse (Cato IV). And, of course, the more time that exists between elections the more independent from the people the President becomes. Interestingly, the Federalists consider a term not as bound to current public opinion as a commendable attribute. In their opinion, the President necessitates an extensive term to complete his/her objectives. Otherwise the ever changing, present passions of the people would rule which wouldn’t be conducive to solving long-term, deep-rooted problems.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>This divergence results from the differing core principles of the two ideologies. Anti-Federalists place ultimate power on the people, demanding that representatives be more numerous. And going so far as to propose that most elections be held annually. Conversely, Federalists believe that often government must take control from the people in order to eventually fulfill public interests but may not satisfy their wants for the moment. Given these central philosophies it can be concluded that the Anti-Federalists possess more democratic values than the Federalists.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Another area of fervent disagreement springs from the Electoral College. Due to the Antifederalists’ heavy emphasis on democratic principles, they prefer a direct election of the President. This would establish an executive from popular rule in the cleanest and most straight-forward way possible. However, the Federalists opt for the filter of the Electoral College to be utilized in the election of the President. And the Electoral College is consistent with their ideals as it hands off responsibility from the voters to, in their judgment, more capable and professional experts than ordinary Americans.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Deeper insight of the two groups’ creeds reveals itself in the character of their arguments. Entirely throughout their writings the Anti-Federalists generally use the same strategy of persuasion: criticizing nondemocratic systems by declaring they promote corruption and listing possible improvements that can be imposed. Yet the personality of the Federalists’ argument is more complex because of the clash between government and the people in their structure. Instead of employing a forthright argument and hammering at it repeatedly like the Anti-Federalists do, the Federalists change their argument. Initially, the Federalists offer the comparison between the proposed President of the Constitution and the Governor of New York. Their point in this paper is to distance the President from the King of England and to downplay the President’s power. But in later writings the tone is sharply different and the essential aim is to illustrate how a mighty executive is a requirement for a republic. Because one can not simultaneously believe the President is weak and strong there’s a deception that the Federalists insert in their first argument. Originally the Federalists compare the President to the Governor of New York because they know this will calm Americans uncertainty of the Constitution, not because the Federalists believe it themselves. This method deceives citizens to keep them from choosing a less capable form of government than that of the Constitution.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>However these factions find common ground in their premise. They each begin with the idea that man is innately bad; but vary in regards to which agent should be kept most in check. The Federalists insist that government is imperative as man isn’t altogether benign. Most immediately their concern is maintaining order of the people through use of government and the second issue is to provide control of the government itself. But the priorities are flip-flopped with the Anti-Federalists. Their emphasis is on preventing an abuse of power from the government and see little harm from allotting an abundance of power to the people.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>A significant ramification of the principles of the Federalists is that they resemble those of an elitist, while the Anti-Federalists views relate more with the commoner. The Federalist outlook constructs a wall between the governors and the people, whereas the Anti-Federalists strive to bring the people into the governing process as much as possible. In the Federalist model governors and people are more segregated to their own respective spheres, with typical Americans given less influence over their government through indirect and infrequent elections. Politics is for politicians in this representation. Paradoxically, to best serve the people the President would need to listen to the people less and lead more.
