                                    <p>This film draws attention to the hostility in and burden of political campaigns as well as the implications of private negotiations in politics. George Clooney writes, directs, and acts in The Ides of March, which allows him to effectively build off the original play, Farragut North, by Beau Willimon. A viewer needs to be aware of the reasons for the changes in the adaptation as well as the political context the film was created in to make sense of what Clooney wanted to say about the political system. This is because the changes and the context contribute to the meaning of the film’s major characters and critical, ambiguous moments. Fortunately, New York Times columnist, Ida, acts as the viewer’s guide by maintaining her integrity. Rather than attempt to convey a traditional political message, The Ides of March focuses on why some voters remain politically optimistic and repeatedly revitalize their faith in a new candidate each election.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The opening scene is entirely original and underscores how someone the public does not know crafts the presentation they judge. Protagonist Stephen Meyers is the “best media mind in the country” and the press secretary to Democratic presidential hopeful Mike Morris. Stephen delivers a speech at the same podium that candidate Morris will repeat later that evening saying he does not believe in any religion, rather “my religion is called the Constitution of the United States of America.” Morris’ relatively extreme political stances are the reason film critic Andrew O’Hehir labels him a “fire-breathing populist revolutionary.” If elected, Morris wants to establish universally paid college and medical care for all Americans and pay for that by mandating two years of national service from every American who turns eighteen, effective immediately. Clooney explains in a press interview how the problem with these policy proposals is not their content but that Stephen constructed them and he does not face the same set of personal “moral questions” that candidate Morris does (ST Media). The solution then is for the public to be informed about campaign staffers’ genuine characters through traditional hard-news journalism, which is exactly what Ida strives to supply.</p>

                                    <p>Both Paul Zara, the primary campaign manager of candidate Morris, and Stephen have a relationship with Ida that illustrates a necessary and legitimate dialogue between political campaigns and the press. An attentive viewer could protest to my claim by pointing out that Ida tries to blackmail Stephen into admitting to his meeting with Tom Duffy, the campaign manager of the last opposing Democratic candidate in this primary race. But Ida actually never reduces herself to tabloid journalism because she chooses not print the story of their meeting when her strong-arming fails to produce a response from Stephen. Frictional partnership like this is a necessity in a healthy and robust dynamic between the media and political campaigns. Both sides understand the other is trying to manipulate them but they need each other to advance their personal ambitions. Ida’s decision to not write a story based on a single source reveals that she did not allow ambition to consume her professional integrity. At the lowest point of her relationship with Stephen, Ida declares, “The only reason you ever treated me well was because I work for the Times. Not because I was your friend. You give me what I want, I write you better stories. Don’t pretend it’s any more than that.” This moment comes after Stephen learns that Governor Morris also had a relationship with the nineteen-year-old intern Molly (she lies to Stephen saying she is twenty) but the presidential candidate’s relationship was not consensual. After his disillusionment the last words Stephen utters to the columnist are “you’re my best friend, Ida.” Ironically, Ida most likely believes Stephen’s final remark was sarcastic because immediately before he tells security personnel to essentially stonewall her. Stephen means this closing sentiment since Ida is the only one that maintains the integrity of her profession.</p>

                                    <p>Governor Morris borrows elements from a great deal of candidates and for that reason The Ides of March should be considered a political thriller without a partisan agenda. Willimon wrote the original play in 2004 after serving on Hillary Clinton’s 2000 Senate race and Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential race. The most evident influence is the 2008 Barack Obama campaign demonstrated by the “Believe” posters of Governor Mike Morris that look remarkably similar to President Obama’s iconic “Hope” and “Change” posters. In fact, Clooney purposefully chose to delay the production of the film until after the 2008 presidential campaign. He admits, “People were too optimistic for such a cynical film!” (Masters). Although Clooney has hosted numerable fundraisers that raised millions in contributions for President Obama’s campaigns, he expected the candidate’s popularity would sour once he took office and did not fulfill all of his promises (Cline). Morris does not appear in the play; originally Paul and Stephen are the two characters involved with Molly. Clooney writes and plays Morris in the film so that the audience would find the filmmakers’ work more relatable to Obama’s presidential campaigns. However, this film focuses on the character of politicians and government generally rather than providing an insight on Obama’s campaign, incumbency, or legacy. George Clooney explains, “[The film] walks that line of picking on everybody… If it’s a political movie, it’s a political movie without pressing a specific agenda” (ST Media). Morris takes staunchly liberal political stances from Democrats and delivers perfect progressive arguments to citizens and the media on topics ranging from the death penalty to gay marriage. From the Republican side, Clooney blends bold political framing and rhetoric into Morris’ character, which are aspects Clooney believes liberals commonly lack. The director insists, “Democrats should talk to Hollywood about how to posture some of these [political issues]. Say you're about to get into tax loopholes. Instead of ‘loopholes,’ say ‘cheating” (Time Magazine). By sidestepping partisanship this political thriller is able to provoke more substantial and objective reflections of the political system.</p>

                                    <p>Political campaign environments can be corrosive towards personal character and they often treat supporters as if they are dispensable. When Anthony Lane, film critic at the New Yorker, gave a lackluster review he did not include this idea in his judgment. Lane asks, “The second half of the film presents [Molly] as a pure victim, so why, in the first half, was the lady such a vamp?” Molly pursues Stephen partly because their relationship feeds her ambition and she kills herself because she is afraid he will reveal the affair with Morris. The filmmakers wanted to capture an environment of ridiculous ambition and volatile emotions where there is “an adrenaline factor, a 25-hours-a-day, eight-days-a-week mentality. People will start dating, cheat on each other and break up all in the course of three days” (Masters). If Molly was purely a victim or a “vamp” then she would be one-dimensional and not reflective of the rollercoaster emotions present in real campaigns. Partly because of her empowered feminist sexuality and partly due to her ambition, Molly took the risk getting involved with the “big shot on campus” to raise her status from a “lowly intern.” Stephen and Senator Thompson, a politician Morris requires for victory, allow their ambitions to more explicitly diminish their moral character—this is shown by their hypocrisy. While literally standing above her in the dark, Stephen preaches to Molly saying, “This is the big leagues… When you make mistakes you lose your right to play.” Immediately after dropping Molly off at an abortion clinic, Paul fires the unsuspecting Stephen for his disloyal “stupid mistake” of meeting Tom Duffy. What is more is the extraordinary speed with which Molly’s and Stephen’s positions are replaced; this conveys the idea that the only position of genuine importance is the head of the campaign. Senator Thompson first informs Stephen the only way Morris will get his support is if the senator is put on the presidential ticket. Quickly after this scene Senator Thompson addresses a crowd alongside Morris and declares, “We’re gonna take this country back from those who have stolen it from us.” The problem is that politicians like Senator Thompson, who use their leverage to maximize self-interest rather than improve social problems, are exactly who the public despises the most.</p>

                                    <p>The film illustrates its theme of compromise by offering an ending that is open to interpretation. Stephen either maintains his integrity or sacrifices his personal honor to impact public policy more significantly. Stephen fulfills his role as Brutus when he backstabs Morris with his knowledge of the affair. Disappointingly, Morris readily accepts his position of being blackmailed and promptly makes Stephen his new primary campaign manager. Stephen only keeps his integrity and truly ruins the Caesar-like Morris if he discloses everything to the press in the closing scene. He attains the most credible position for himself to effectively end Morris’ political career, and possibly his own. However, Stephen proves his intellect and a viewer could easily characterize him as someone who believes the ends justify the means. After all Stephen admits he needed to “play dirty” in the past to win but he can only do that if he believes in the cause. Never before has Stephen been as “starry-eyed” about a candidate as Morris. Despite the atrocious revelation, Morris’ ideas are still as attractive to Stephen as they were before. All Stephen has to do to make a “real difference in people’s lives” is sell his soul. Stephen’s moral dilemma is not as simple as abandoning the Morris campaign because only Morris can bring about the policies Stephen desires; staff members comment how the opposing Democratic presidential hopeful does not stand a chance against any Republican in the general election. The choice that Stephen makes is amplified from the more mundane compromises of integrity that real politicians must make. Clooney observes how “[his] father ran for Congress in 2004, and [he] got a sense that there is no way to achieve much success without a certain amount of compromise” (Time Magazine). The stakes of moral compromise are elevated in the film to make viewers wonder whether concrete policy changes are worth overlooking hideous personal characteristics of the only politician who has the power to enact them.</p>

                                    <p>The Ides of March suggests that the inherent opportunity for improvement of political issues is responsible for stimulating optimism and for why voters continually show up each election. This film’s subtlety reflects on the political process rather than overtly or straightforwardly asserting a new insight about it. Critics who give the film unfavorable reviews expect something different than what it offers. A. O. Scott at the New York Times asserts, “Powerful men often treat women as sexual playthings. Reporters do not always get things right. Politicians sometimes lie. If any of that sounds like news to you, then you may well find The Ides of March downright electrifying.” Only some critics grasp the film’s nuance. Daniel Carlson responds to this type of criticism saying viewers will not find “any shocking revelations about the way of the world here, but then, Clooney isn’t necessarily going for them. He’s just talking about disappointment, and the way we’re all doomed to forever forget and relearn the harsh truth.” The message is not so much the revelation of dirty politics as it is the question of why has the public been fooled into believing Morris would be any different. The film leaves evidence indicating that politically interested individuals are revitalized each election because they are able to separate the office from the incumbents. Although Stephen has seen more than his fair share of cynical politics as he has been on “more campaigns than most people have by the time they’re forty,” he does not let his experience diminish his belief that profound change in American public policy is possible. In a one-on-one, pre-disillusionment conversation between Morris and Stephen, the governor advances a perspective with a different tone than his speeches saying “[if] you make it to the White House you do your eight years, if you last that long, and then what? You get off the train every morning at Farragut North and trudge to some consulting firm with all the other political has-beens.” Morris does not buy his own product and this difference between himself and Stephen exemplifies how the politically passionate are destined to be brought down by the inability of government to make fast dramatic changes in public policy. Ida, the most pragmatic voice, is the one who is correct about Morris and politics generally. The Ides of March considers how the public’s care for political issues fuels flawed candidates to soar to the highest political offices where they will inevitably disappoint.</p>

                                    <p>While the filmmakers’ work casts several aspects of politics in an unattractive light, The Ides of March also provides reason to not disparagingly sink into cynicism. Politicians mislead supporters into believing their character is the antithesis of their actual character. The overall virtuosity of politicians and their staff is at risk from an environment that threatens their moral character. Clooney also created this film to reflect on Democrats’ disappointment of President Obama when he campaigned as someone who would change the rules that have rigged the political game but he has governed as a moderate pragmatist favoring incremental progress. The public sees many politicians like Morris but the personal defects of candidates distract from the purpose of campaigns and government, which is to the remedy the social problems that only the public sector can alleviate. That is the reason why the Morris’ political arguments on the state of the nation and how to make it better are so incredibly compelling. Everyone can turn on to politics, as Stephen does, by engrossing himself or herself with the actual political issues, which deserve more attention than the promises or faults of any candidate.</p>
