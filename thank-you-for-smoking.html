                                    <p>Few professions are entirely benevolent. In Thank You For Smoking, Nick Naylor, a lobbyist for Big Tobacco, accepts the moral ambivalence of his chosen occupation. The film mocks every significant character, and each functions as a representative of his or her respective industry. What’s more is that they all sell out their integrity in order to achieve in their occupations. The result is that citizens aren’t presented with arguments that are in their best interest; citizens are however, at fault for not realizing their authorities act in self-interest. Although the film explicitly states an individual must think critically about their authorities’ real motivations, it implicitly suggests no individual has the ability to cut threw the spin.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The images of lobbyists, the press, politicians, and even Hollywood producers are subject to a satirical portrayal. Even though a reporter and a senator look down on Nick for what he does for a living, they also engage in immoral behavior to benefit themselves. To write a popular, career-advancing story, the reporter Heather Holloway fools Nick into believing they share an honest relationship. But in actually, Heather uses the couple’s intimacy to extract Nick’s distinctive, private secrets, using them as ammunition in a scathing profile piece of the lobbyist. Similarly, Vermont Senator Ortolan Finistirre claims to be a populist as he attempts to label cigarettes as poison, but reveals his true nature when he loathes that Nick survived an assassination attempt and will win sympathy as a victim. We expect more from the politician than the lobbyist because of the former’s noble societal role to serve the public good. But no one in the film is honorable towards society. After the damaging exposé Nick’s son Joey motivates his father to defend Big Tobacco again by reciting Nick’s line, “If you want an easy job, go work for the Red Cross.” Jobs rarely are as ethically unchallenging as a benign cause like the Red Cross; the vast majority of jobs shown in the movie present the individual with ethically dubious situations and opportunities.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Thank You For Smoking demonstrates how arguments put forth to the public usually aren’t in the people’s best interest; this inability of the public to see through the facade of authorities allows immoral behavior to thrive. Watchers of the film are meant to laugh at the fictional audience. The film offers no evidence to indicate that the fictional audience ever dismisses or even attempts to question the numerous scenes of slanted arguments. Indeed, Nick somehow with simply unscrupulous brilliance convinces the audience of a daytime television show that cancer researchers are bent on the masses developing cancer because of an economic motivation. This point of being skeptical about someone’s motivations is greatly emphasized, as it is Nick’s tragic flaw in regards to his humiliating, but accurate, exposé by Heather. In a way, viewers of the film are to blame. Even though viewers can recognize Nick’s unethical stances as such, they likely root for him to overcome his obstacles and may fall victim themselves to the best spinner.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>	Regardless of what Nick believes, the film overall conveys that being smarter than its fictional audience isn’t so simple. During a committee hearing, Nick advocates against the poison label on cigarettes, citing the libertarian principles of self-responsibility and freedom of choice. Yet the film illustrates it isn’t promoting those ideas with its scene of an extensive tobacco team brainstorming ways to get young people to smoke more cigarettes. Likewise, Senator Finistirre has a considerable team to help be seen as a politician who is taking on an evil big business, not one just seeking to win reelection. Nick’s argument in the hearing implies that there’s an even playing field between the spinners and the individual. But no person has enough competence to compete with a squad of marketing or political experts. Thus, someone is more likely to be misled by a persuasion team than uncover the actual purpose behind an argument. It’s ironic the viewers of the film are told not to be influenced by spinners, because that statement itself is an act of deception.</p>
