                                    <p>A profound change in wealth has occurred over the past three decades in America. Since the 1970’s the median income level has flat-lined, according to research from the Census Bureau (Ferguson 6). But during the same period, the wealth of the nation’s top earners has grown substantially. The Economist reports how top one percent’s income “doubled since 1980, from 10% to 20%.” Among the top 0.1 percent the increases are even larger, with their income quadrupling during the same time (3). The newspaper even states that the transformation in the United States’ concentration of wealth is “on a scale that matches, or even exceeds, the first Gilded Age” (3). However solutions to this systemic inequality vary greatly across the political spectrum.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Liberals and conservatives hold different opinions about the source of income inequality and thus offer alternative solutions. Conservatives point to a variety of social factors and leftist welfare policies as the culprit to income inequality. This thinking lends itself to a straightforward solution of rolling back the less constructive social changes and repealing the liberal legislation that exacerbated the issue. Conversely, liberals contend that global events as well as foolish governmental actions created the inequality. In their view, government established many of the conditions that fostered income inequality; but government can also modify those conditions to promote equality for all. At the center of the conflict between these political factions is their perspective about whether the income gap is fair. The right has faith in America’s social ladders, while the left feels most citizens have been robbed of opportunity. This core divergence in thinking impacts their impression of the matter and proposed reforms.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Conservatives identify various social trends and Democratic policies that have engendered income inequality, although differ considerably on their intensity.  Thomas Sowell, a columnist of National Review, represents the furthest on the right. According to Sowell, one key facet for the vast difference in wealth is due simply to the laziness of certain Americans’. Sowell points out “There are more heads of household working full-time and year-round in the top 5 percent [of wage earners] than in the bottom 20 percent” (7). This attitude justifies the income gap because it maintains that the wealthiest individuals undoubtedly work more feverishly and intelligently for their high incomes. When low-income Americans’ lack of ambition is magnified by deconstructive liberal initiatives, the results are even more disastrous. Sowell asserts “When you make it unnecessary for many people to work, fewer people work” (4). The author bolsters his claim by citing the record numbers of Americans on food stamp programs and disability payments. Essentially, the most extreme conservatives believe that a large segment of the nation has developed a do-nothing work ethic that welfare programs only worsen.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Charles Murray and Niall Ferguson, two right leaning political scientists, stand in contrast to Sowell in a variety of ways, labeling themselves “true conservatives” (5). Ferguson contends that far-right conservatives “accuse President Obama of waging ‘class warfare’ whenever he brings [income inequality] up” (4). Whereas a true conservative recognizes that if an economy only serves a tiny elite it loses its legitimacy (5). The difference among these parties is subtle, but crucial. Conservative voices like Sowell claim that the economy and government serve all Americans, some to the point where it is detrimental. Yet a true conservative states that the balance of the economy has been tilted in favor of the rich elite. Both sides are united in what regard as the root of the problem, a social attitude and class change.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Murray sees two nations, not the ninety-nine percent versus the one percent, but rather the cognitive elite representing the top five percent and the lower class comprising the rest. Some of the differences among these classes are inherent; Murray declares that the cognitive elite are generally smarter than the lower class (11).  Other distinctions are social ones that occurred over time. He contends that the lower class has more dramatically declining marriage rates, higher crime rates, a less sincere work ethic, and less religiosity than the cognitive elite (19-23). This means that the primary four social domains: family, work, local community, and faith “are in a state of collapse” (24). Each of the conservative interpretations states that the bottom majority of Americans changed something in their character that brought about the present income inequality. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>On the other side of the isle, Democrats on income inequality assert that the government, the technological revolution, and the richest Americans themselves all contributed to the current disproportionate distribution of wealth. Adam Davidson, a columnist of The New York Times, argues that government failed to strengthen labor unions in the late 1970’s. This factored into the stagnation of the working class’ pay (7). But government did deregulate the financial sector in the late 1970’s and during the 1980’s, which spurred a bull market on Wall Street. This is important because the most affluent individuals are much more likely to have stocks and financial assets (7-8). More recently, the Bush tax cuts provided the rich with a financial break while creating little overall job growth (Ungar 12). Furthermore, there’s evidence that the technological revolution benefitted the wealthiest citizens more than everyone else. This occurred because the revolution displaced much of the blue-collar force, their jobs becoming less valuable due to smarter tools. Meanwhile, information-intensive jobs that required a high level of education such as lawyers, doctors, engineers and other professional occupations were put in a more powerful position (Davidson 12). The effect of the public sector and the new computer and internet technologies on income inequality can largely be measured empirically. But the influence of the top one percent on politics could be even more significant, but evaluating such is less concrete.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The theory that the most financial well-off influence the political system is supported by both common sense and secondary evidence. John Cassidy, a columnist of The New Yorker, explains, “[Top earners] have a big incentive to get more involved politically: to prevent the adoption of redistributive policies” (11). There is no logical reason that an individual would not want to protect his or her own income; it would be unnatural not to. Other hints also indicate a corrupting influence. Politicians undoubtedly spend more of their time with the most affluent than with average income citizens (Schmitt 10). Additionally, the change in campaign finance laws in recent years allows billionaires such as the Koch brothers to donate more funds to a political candidate than other independent groups (Gold 2). Simple reasoning and a several other elements suggest that rich individuals pursue political power out of self-interest, and that politicians increasingly require their support.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Due to their different interpretations conservatives and liberals offer contrasting strategies to remedy income inequality. The left favors strong governmental intervention while the right would redesign the nation’s welfare system. Robert Reich, Secretary of Labor under the Clinton Administration, has been a long time advocate of raising the minimum wage. Reich asserts that raising the minimum wage will aid the workers struggling the most. He also maintains that the increase will actually elevate job growth not deter it, as low-income workers will have more purchasing power and are more likely to spend it (Cohen 5-7). The other critical aspect of the Democrats’ plan is increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans. Josh Boak, a columnist of The Wall Street Journal, points to the success of higher income taxes in California as evidence that the policy would work nationally. California’s voters increased taxes on individuals earning income over $250,000 and added another tax for millionaires (28). The liberal plan for solving income inequality would amend the tax code to create a more progressive tax code, where taxes rise with income.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Reforming the tax code is an item that both sides agree is necessary for a legitimate solution. However, conservatives such as Ferguson prefer a more simplified system. Ferguson claims that a simpler, flatter tax code with more standardized rates would “restore the incentives that used to exist for everyone to work hard” (33). Moreover, the answer from the right is to eliminate the current social safety net, because altogether the system could bankrupt America as it is continually increasing budget deficits. America’s welfare system also discourages innovation as well as quick reentry into the work force (Ferguson 31-33). To more easily understand these solutions one should recognize the connection between each advocate’s perspective and their proposed reform.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Liberals and conservatives disagree on where the fault lays for income inequality, which is why their ideas for improvement are so far apart. Democrats generally think that the low and middle classes were not meaningfully involved in bringing about today’s wealth disparities. Instead they argue the income gap was brought about through a combination of poor governmental judgment, a new technological era, and a power play by the rich. Therefore, liberals regard the vast majority of Americans as victims to forces outside their control. Their proposed progressive tax code is built to increase opportunity and economic mobility for this expansive group. The left doesn’t mean to punish the rich by imposing burdening taxes; but rather liberals feel that the bottom ninety-nine percent of Americans have been cheated out of a fair chance to succeed. This is the main point of contention for the factions.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Everyone in America has a chance to succeed, according to the right, but due to various factors more citizens over the past few decades have squandered their opportunity. With this mentality a redistribution of wealth would benefit those who were at fault. Redistributing the nation’s wealth would also operate in a similar fashion to our inadequate welfare system. Individual Americans could lose their drive to reach the top because if the income gap became too great they would expect the government to restore balance. This question of the fairness of income inequality is of vital importance in evaluating the health of America and its ideals. The American dream means that if one works hard they can get ahead. This controversy is a debate over whether that dream is still alive.</p>
