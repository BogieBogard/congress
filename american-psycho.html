                                    <p>The following is an essay on the book <i>American Psycho</i> for the class "Banned Books and Novel Ideas".
                                    </p>

                                    <p>American Psycho aims to demonstrate how placing importance on swallow, surface-level qualities leads to a deterioration of the soul. This is illustrated through the yuppie culture which has caused, or at least exacerbated, Patrick Bateman’s insanity. Many elements contribute to this corrupting culture such as hyper-egocentrism, a compulsion to be superior, and the unbearableness of a life without purpose. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The absurd amount of egomania is apparent in the characters’ obliviousness to others, disregard for society at large, and Bateman’s fixation on his body. Continually throughout the work characters are mistaken as other individuals. This occurs so frequently that generally a misidentification happens almost every chapter. The longest and most noteworthy error takes place when Paul Owen mistakes Bateman for Marcus Halberstram. And these blunders are pertinent because they reveal that every person in the novel can't even learn the first, most foundational attribute of any other person: their name. This fact furthers the characterization of each character as entirely self-absorbed. And this interpretation is compounded by the inability of Bateman’s acquaintances to listen to his numerous explicit psychotic disclosures.</p>

                                    <p>Another component of the hyper-egocentrism is Bateman’s indifference both personally and globally to others. Bateman’s persistent terrorizing and disdain for the homeless and underclass confirms his apathy towards people globally and generally. And his relationship with Evelyn shows his lack of concern for people personally. Although Evelyn is Patrick’s fiancé, he doesn’t care when she cheats on him with Tim and completely ignores her repeated suicidal signals. Patrick’s disinterest in people both globally and personally serve as other aspects to characterize him as someone with no redeemable qualities. Often in novels a character may not seem to care about people in general but he/she has concern for his/her own personal connections. But because Patrick cares for absolutely no one but himself, his role as a true psychopath is further developed.</p>

                                    <p>Bateman’s fixation on his body also supports the element of hyper-egocentrism. Through his facial massages, intense workouts, manicures, tanning salons, pedicures, and various appearance products, Bateman’s focus on his body can be described as excessive. And this is significant because Bateman shows motivation for only two things in Bret Easton Ellis’ work: improving his body along with status and satisfying his depraved urges. By priding himself on the way his back muscles look in the mirror and counting the number of crunches he can do, the audience perceives Bateman’s exercises as simply vain not as a healthy activity. It’s vain because the reasons why Bateman molds his body isn’t to be in great shape and health but to achieve the greatest self-appearance. Put another way, instead of marching towards an admirable goal like self-improvement, Bateman just wants to look better than everyone else. And in that context Bateman’s strive for a perfect body is also connected with his compulsion to be superior. </p>

                                    <p>But Bateman’s compulsion to be superior is better exemplified by the restaurants and clubs he visits, his clothing, and his reaction to his coworkers’ business cards.. By visiting only the newest, hottest clubs Bateman can achieve the image he wants: super sleek, connected, knowledgeable, and young. For these reasons he is obsessed with Dorsia. Dorsia represents the place with the highest social status. The restaurants reveal that Bateman believes in distinct separations of class which are determined even by minuscule details such as where one eats. Thus by dining at a more expensive, upscale restaurant Bateman deems himself above others.</p>

                                    <p>Bateman is incessantly identifying every article of clothing other characters are wearing. And the brands of the clothing are critical to Bateman because of their financial worth. In essence, Bateman thinks that people wear their worth. Bateman’s view isn’t based on practicality. The criticism of others’ clothing isn’t based on their style or fit, but rather solely the brand and that adds to his superficial character.</p>

                                    <p>However, the business card scene is the finest indicator of Bateman’s need to be better. Bateman feels immense pain due to not having the most celebrated business card. And the scene intentionally tries to pick the most arbitrary and insignificant of items to compare and compete. The ridiculousness of the scene is created because the subject, the business cards, is not supposed to matter. Therefore, the scene displays Bateman’s insatiable need to dominate others. </p>


                                    <p>Everything in Bateman’s character encourages the perspective that he feels compelled to reign over others. By attending the best schools at the time, Harvard and then Harvard Law School, and his position as a vice president at a major Wall Street firm prove that he must prevail over everyone. Through Bateman, Ellis means to convey that there is a limit to appropriate competition. Not everything is a contest and the business card scene illustrates a competition reduced to nonsense. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Patrick’s yearning to outrank others and his egomania contributed to his lunacy but Ellis makes clear it was the unbearableness of his lack of purpose which dealt the final blow. In the following passage Bateman details several of his philosophies: 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>“This was the geography around which my reality revolved: it did not occur to me, ever, that people were good or that a man was capable of change or that the world could be a better place through one’s taking pleasure in a feeling or a look or a gesture, of receiving another person’s love or kindness. Nothing was affirmative, the term “generosity of spirit” applied to nothing, was a clich'e, was some kind of bad joke. Sex is mathematics. Individuality no longer an issue. What does intelligence signify? Define reason. Desire—meaningless. Intellect is not a cure. Justice is dead. Fear, recrimination, innocence, sympathy, guilt, waste, failure, grief, were things, emotions, that no one really felt anymore. Reflection is useless, the world is senseless. Evil is its only permanence. God is not alive. Love cannot be trusted. Surface, surface, surface was all that anyone found meaning in… this was civilization as I saw it, colossal and jagged…”
                                    </p>

                                    <p>This passage is central to the work’s satire because it reflects how all of the characters have no meaningful morals or principles. And thus Ellis hopes to impart that such a lifestyle is devoid of significance. The dogmas presented by Bateman are nihilistic and the audience is not meant to agree with or like the this outlook. In this section more specifically Bateman discredits several benevolent virtues with rapid succession. Patrick scolds generosity, love, compassion, and intellect. This is a broad range of core ethical ideals that everyone holds. He even attacks meaning itself when he states, “Reflection is useless, the world is senseless.” When Ellis reveals Bateman’s doctrine the protagonist is isolated from the audience. And that is because the values to which Bateman and those he surrounds himself with subscribe to are what Ellis is denouncing.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Ellis goes out of his way to show that none of the characters have any true convictions or serious opinions in politics, the arts, or anything that is deep and has complexity or nuance. Instances of this in the text are introduced when a few of Bateman’s girlfriends were unable to name a single planet and resumed conversing about furs and when in a limo none of Patrick’s group pays attention to a televised speech by Ronald Reagan. At the work’s core Ellis depicts the world’s culture as exhibiting few admirable emotions or moments of human decency and Bateman exhibits none.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>There is emphasis on the word “surface” in the selected passage as Bateman iterates it three times. The word stands for the yuppie society’s values. Ellis’ criticism and his satire are the values of Bateman and the society or generally the lack there of. However there’s a sizable distinction between the yuppie society at large and Bateman. Bateman acts as a figure of what the culture’s values and standards can do to the individual: corrupt and decay one’s mind and psyche. There’s no meaning in the actual horrendous deeds Patrick performs except that it was the creed of his culture which led him to that point. Of course, Ellis doesn’t mean to assert that every wall street broker is a serial killer. But Ellis does mean to claim that the moral code of that culture results in a defect in character with overall desensitization, ruthlessness, and narcissism. These traits are then intensely amplified, as is the custom of satire, to the point where Patrick feels content murdering because he is incapable of any benign human feelings. At its heart, Ellis’ American Psycho is a relentless attack on the values of a society he considers poisonous to the very spirit of its inhabitants.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>By demonizing the effect that the society’s virtueless philosophy had on Patrick, Ellis establishes a link between society and the individual. Patrick’s yuppie community not only releases a venom on his psyche, but they illustrate that an individual will erode without a community that has a strong moral backbone. Therefore, Ellis ties the individual and the society in an intimate but overall one-way relationship. Bateman’s mental health is crippled by his surrounding community, but he cannot create any impact on the public even with the most abhorrent actions. This dynamic can be cited as one of the central reasons Patrick feels compelled to commit despicable deeds. When there appears to be no consequences for his behavior, Patrick cannot think that his behavior matters. Stuck in a deeply inhospitable moral environment, Patrick is lost without any proper virtuous direction to discourage him from acting like a psychopath.
