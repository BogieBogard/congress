                                    <p>Gregory Mankiw takes an unconventional stance on income inequality in his article “Defending the One Percent.” Most commentators on income inequality argue that the current wealth disparity in the United States is a serious contemporary issue but they differ in their proposed solutions. Generally liberals favor changing the tax code to make it more progressive, meaning that if one’s income increases his/her tax rate would also increase. On the contrary, conservatives widely cite a departure from traditional family values and ineffective governmental welfare policy as the root causes of income inequality. Thus from the conservative perspective America should return to its wholesome traditions and fundamentally redesign social spending.  However Mankiw, who has earned a PhD at Harvard, does not align himself with either of these common viewpoints in his popular paper that was published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives. Instead Mankiw contends that income inequality comes about naturally and that proposals to diminish the income gap are principally flawed.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Mankiw agrees that income inequality exists and claims that it inevitably will be present because of ordinary occurrences. The author points out that the share of wealth owned by the top one percent in relation to the wealth of the bottom ninety-nine percent of Americans “rose from 7.7 percent in 1973 to 17.4 percent in 2010.” (21). Moreover, the gains by the top 0.01 percent of wage earners are even more dramatic. When using the same comparative model the wealth of the top 0.01 percent rose from 0.5 percent in 1973 to 3.3 percent in 2010 (22). But these unequal distributions are not unjust because entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs, J.K. Rowling, and Steven Spielberg properly earned their sizable wealth. Mankiw insists that without these entrepreneurs people around the world wouldn’t enjoy the iPod, the Harry Potter books, or Spielberg’s popular films (21). Although great income inequality is created from the invention of these products, the entrepreneur’s wealth is fair because he/she took a risk and succeeded.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>This theory comes into conflict with the perspective of an unlisted author at The Economist. The author representing the British newspaper maintains that competitors would fill the void if these entrepreneurs were absent. Another children’s literature series would define the 2000s if the Harry Potter books were nonexistent; rather than Jaws characterizing the 1970s another thriller movie would (3). The idea from the author at The Economist is that the world has no shortage of geniuses. Because competitors could seize the opportunity, these entrepreneurs are not particularly special. Through this logic America’s current income inequality would be just as severe if these entrepreneurs were never born. This is because the unique talents of Jobs and the others did not by themselves engender income inequality. While Mankiw encounters sharp criticism on his entrepreneurship argument, he presents the audience with several other justifications for income inequality, some of which employ a situated ethos appeal.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>By relying on a study from an expert economist Mankiw asserts that income is related to the intelligence quotient (IQ), which is largely genetic. Bruce Sacerdote, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College, has performed numerous studies relating to the effect of various social and genetic factors on income. The goal of Sacerdote’s research in his own words is to “[collect] data to enhance our understanding of why children and youth turn out the way they do” (Dartmouth College). Also, Sacerdote does not appear to be a severe partisan of any political ideology as he has been quoted in a variety of publications ranging from the conservative The Wall Street Journal as well as the liberal The New York Times (Dartmouth College). Mankiw reports that one of Sacerdote’s studies found that “while 33 percent of the variance of family income is explained by genetic heritability, only 11 percent is explained by the family environment” (25). Mankiw uses Sacerdote’s findings to conclude that generational persistence in income is a result of genetics (25).  This means that an individual’s heredity rather than his/her opportunity in terms of social mobility is the primary cause of the individual’s income. Yet this argument can be criticized as a fallacy of authority (also known as a genetic fallacy.) Mankiw does not describe how Sacerdote arrived at these exact statistical results and that is concerning. Attempting to precisely measure the influence of the family environment on an individual’s income is next to impossible because that influence is both a subjective and unempirical factor. Mankiw’s assertion would be akin to claiming that a particular conversation between a child and his/her parents impacted the child’s future income by five percent. Such a claim is inherently nonsensical and has no place in a well-respected academic paper.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>On the topic of equal opportunity Mankiw utilizes an invented ethos appeal. Mankiw describes his personal experience in the middle-class education system and declares that the education of the middle-class is comparable to the education of the top one percent. “[N]either of my parents were college graduates” Mankiw states among other details that illustrate that his circumstances were not exceptional (26). Theses details act as an invented ethos appeal because by listing characteristics of himself that are familiar to the middle class Mankiw hopes to achieve credibility as a spokesperson for the middle-class in regards to education. However, this appeal can be referred to as an anecdotal fallacy. The individual educational experience of Mankiw should not be expanded to portray the contemporary education experience of the whole middle-class. One obstacle the middle-class confronts is the deep cuts in education spending in states across the country during the past few years as budget revenues have been declining (Whitaker 6-9). On the other hand, a child of a family who is a part of the top one percent is more likely to attend a private school where he/she would not suffer from the school having fewer funds and thus a less desirable education.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Additionally, Mankiw denies that income inequality is a social problem on the basis of utilitarianism with a logos appeal.  Utilitarianism in this context means that an act is right if it promotes happiness. The author points out that no flawless method exists for definitively knowing the utility that any individual takes pleasure in. Mankiw speculates that eventually our society may be able to use an advanced scientific method to determine the exact happiness one experiences; however currently determining one’s happiness, or utility, is entirely subjective. Therefore, Mankiw states, “[T]here is no scientific way to establish whether the marginal dollar consumed by one person produces more or less utility than the marginal dollar consumed by a neighbor” (28). Although Mankiw’s logic is coherent when presented within his carefully crafted structure, the author representing The Economist views Mankiw’s conclusion as completely invalid. The author of the newspaper rebuts Mankiw’s statement claiming “a dollar is worth more to someone who earns $30,000 per year than to someone who earns $3 million” (9). Interestingly, the criticizer’s response to Mankiw’s intricate theoretical model is to apply simple everyday reasoning to the situation.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Another main objective of Mankiw is to dismantle the arguments from liberals that advocate further taxation of the rich. For example, Mankiw commentates on the so-called “Buffett rule.” This rule, whose name comes from the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, demands that all millionaires pay at least the tax rate of the average middle-class citizen. Mankiw dismisses the logic behind the “Buffett rule” because the calculations of Warren Buffett’s income and his receptionist are inaccurate. For Buffett’s income to be only 17.7 percent the calculation must only take into account the dividends and capital gains tax and leave out the fact that the income was already taxed at the corporate level (30). The receptionist of Warren Buffett has a tax rate of 30 percent because of the bundling of the payroll tax with the standard income tax. In fact, data conducted by the Congressional Budget Office supports the assertion that the American tax code is already progressive (30). This is one of Mankiw’s strongest arguments because it relies entirely on empirical data and includes several sources.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Furthermore, Mankiw condemns the liberal argument that the rich’s income does not reflect their contribution to society with another logos appeal. This is illustrated through chief executive officer (CEO) compensation. Overall CEO pay has increased over the past three decades but more specifically the rate of CEO pay among private companies has outpaced that of public companies. This is important because public companies have faced fiercer criticism of their board of directors being too cozy with the CEO rather than shareholders, which results in a higher CEO compensation (30-31). Through this rationale Mankiw deduces that the real reason CEO compensation has substantially increased is because CEO talent has naturally become more valued in the modern business environment with its fast-paced rate of change. But this declaration is guilty of the composition/division fallacy. Even if the compensation of the leaders of businesses has legitimately increased that does not indicate that an artificial increase in compensation has not occurred in any occupation. Mankiw is too quick to generalize that the trend of one discipline applies to the entire economic system.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>In a rare use of a pathos appeal, along with a logos appeal, Mankiw attacks the philosophical framework of liberals on the topic of income inequality. Mankiw maintains that the redistribution of wealth is “an enforcement of a social insurance contract” meaning that regardless of whether an individual is born rich or poor, or intelligent or stupid, redistribution will help level the playing field (32). Yet Mankiw contends with a thought experiment that if the same thinking for redistribution were imposed for kidney transplant then most levelheaded citizens would not agree. In this scenario an individual would be guaranteed a kidney if he/she was unfortunate enough to need a transplant. Also a healthy donor would be forced to give up one of his/her kidneys. This thought experiment serves as an effective pathos appeal because of the gratuitous nature of society forcibly stealing a kidney from an unwilling donor.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Although Mankiw falls short of producing a perfect argument, his technique of rhetoric is authentically academic. In order to genuinely appreciate Mankiw’s style of rhetoric, the reader should recognize his intended audience. Within the world of economic academia frequent thought experiments such as the ones employed by Mankiw are not only tolerated but are encouraged as the main type of argumentation. However as demonstrated continuously by the author representing The Economist, Mankiw’s logical progression can grow perhaps too complex at times, straying away from common wisdom. No matter how unsound Mankiw’s arguments may be, Mankiw’s opinions are important for an exhaustive dialogue on income inequality. The cases brought by major newspapers that I cited in my previous essays are fundamental to a fruitful discussion on income inequality. The other speakers on income inequality generally used the same rhetorical techniques that Mankiw used such as referring to statistics or making conclusions based on logic and facts. Yet the previous sources rarely, if ever, offered an in-depth hypothetical scenario to further develop their arguments. Every type of argument should be included in a worthwhile debate. Mankiw may not be the most influential voice in this controversy but the inclusion of this conservative, elite academic is crucial in order for the conversation on income inequality to be completely comprehensive.
