                                    <p>The income gap in America has grown considerably over the past three decades. President Obama has stated that rising income inequality is the “defining challenge of our time” (Newell 1). Income inequality is the extent to which income is unevenly distributed among a society. One problem with income inequality is that it can at least give the appearance of political corruption because often the wealthy elite has the potential to influence policy (Schmitt 9-10). Additionally, numerous experts and extensive research attest to the idea that an extraordinarily high disparity of wealth damages democracies and engenders a permanent underclass (Skarda 9, 13-15). Some variance of income across a population makes sense and is natural; but stark differences in wealth often reflect systemic problems. If we live in a society where the wealth disparity is severe, the rules of the economic game could be rigged. In this scenario, the individual loses his/her chance to climb the income ladder and then we lose the essence of the American Dream. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>There is no silver bullet solution for solving income inequality. When analyzing the issue from an empirical perspective certain elements of a strong progressive tax code stand out as effective and important. Raising the minimum wage is a topic of contention; however empirical analysis most often demonstrates that it would be part of a comprehensive solution. Moreover, eliminating inefficiencies in the social safety net is a strategy often employed by conservatives that has merit. Another critical aspect is maintaining America’s equality of opportunity. And that factor should be bipartisan. These reforms are among the most powerful in their ability to curtail income inequality.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Although not all parties agree that the US should raise its minimum wage, experts and statistics support an increase. Members of the Council of Economic Advisers, or in other words some of the best economists in the country, assert “[T]he minimum wage of $7.25 an hour today is 23 percent lower than it was in 1968. If it had kept up with inflation and with the growth of average labor productivity, it would be $25 an hour” (Tyson 1). Also, the American public overwhelmingly supports raising the minimum wage. 71 percent of the American people approve of an increase from $7.25 to $9; (Saad 1).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>One of the most persuasive arguments from conservatives is that our welfare system should be altered to tackle poverty more directly. Put another way, the public services we have available need to provide twenty-first century solutions.  For example, manufacturing is an industry that is drying up in the United States. It’s smart for us to invest in those workers in manufacturing who are no longer required to acquire new skills to reenter the workforce. Another improvement would be to expand the flexibility of federal aid programs. When an individual has to work a full-time job but wants to go to college to get a better job he/she usually can’t undertake a traditional four-year college program (Neuman 9).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>America’s largest obstacle in reducing income inequality is creating an equality of opportunity. One of the most concrete methods of making opportunity more equal is through education. The quality of and access to education has been falling in recent years. This is shown by huge cuts in public education in states across the country. Another factor is that tuition has been rising at most universities while at the same time grants overall have been declining (Belkin & Porter 2-4). This indicates that higher barriers of entry exist for higher education. This is an issue universally agreed on as an area of reform and also where the most progress can be achieved. One of the least controversial economic theories is that a more educated workforce will benefit the opportunity and overall economy for everyone. Therefore a proper investment in public and higher education is essential for combating income inequality.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>	Government can be the most valuable force in changing America’s income inequality because it has the power to change the rules of the economic game to give people a fairer shot. The plans that I campaigned for in this presentation would establish a more reasonable baseline compensation for an individual’s work and restructure the nation’s welfare system to focus its resources on goal-oriented programs. Furthermore, repairing America’s pathways of social advancement is key to limiting income inequality.  Restoring the nation’s income inequality back to more benign levels is about more than just narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor. Solving our growing and dramatic income inequality is about ensuring the integrity of America’s promise of opportunity.
