                                    <p>Symbolism in Children of Men functions as a sort of litmus test. The film presents its viewers with conflicting evidence for what various characters and events mean, resulting in different but legitimate interpretations. Indeed, film critic David Walsh states, “The difficulty is that the film’s various elements do not fully cohere.” The most well supported interpretations of the film generally fall into two categories. Either the viewer interprets the premise, major characters, and ending as meaningfully religious and hopeful or as circumstantial, meaningless, and futile.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>How a viewer attributes the cause of infertility is the first factor that determines which category he or she belongs to. Viewers can conclude that humans are now sterile as a consequence of mankind’s own behavior or because of divine will. Jasper, a hippy friend of the protagonist Theo, mentions how “genetic experiments, gamma rays, [and] pollution” could have played a part. A viewer can think humankind caused the infertility predicament by taking careful note of the dialogue and imagery characterizing Britain as a polluted wasteland. Alternatively, a viewer could observe the remarks of emerging religious cults called the “Repenters” and “Renouncers” as evidence that infertility was the result of divine will. This same conflict of interpretation is found in humankind’s opportunity for a second chance.</p>

                                    <p>Kee, the first pregnant woman in eighteen years, offers inconsistent evidence for her symbolism as the biblical character Mary. To argue Kee does represent the biblical figure, a viewer could cite Kee’s and Theo’s biblical attire. Kee wears a shawl, a frequently worn garment in the biblical era. And Mary herself often wears a shawl in artful depictions. Also Theo changes into sandals shortly after taking on his role of delivering Kee to the Human Project, a secretive organization trying to solve infertility. Sandals are referenced in the Genesis, Mark, and Amos books of the Bible and were the most common footwear in the time of Christ because of their inexpensiveness (Biblical Archaeology). Moreover, Jasper declares, “Kee, your baby is the miracle the whole world has been waiting for,” a statement that could be regarded as a reference to Christ. Conversely, viewers can think Kee does not represent Mary by citing the incontestable point that Kee is not a virgin.</p>

                                    <p>Multiple views are legitimate in regards to whether divine will is the reason for infertility because of how Kee’s pregnancy relates to the film’s theme of illegal immigration. Undoubtedly, the viewer is meant to disdain Britain’s government with its own shade of Orwellian totalitarianism and gross treatment of illegal immigrants in public cages. Film critic Ethan Alter claims that the movie “makes a potent case against the anti-immigrant sentiment”. Indeed, Children of Men’s director Alfonso Cuarón makes his views clear in his film production notes writing “what right do we have to close the door on people that are in need… Compassion is certainly something we could use” (Walsh).  The first new baby comes from an unwelcomed refugee or “fugee” rather than Britain, the one country that has yet to “collapse” and still “soldiers on”. Therefore, a viewer could assert Kee’s pregnancy was a gift from a divine power meant to show that immigrants should be treated equally, because an immigrant is the answer to saving humanity’s future. But on the other hand, a viewer who didn’t think infertility was caused by a divine power could point out that regardless of the cause, a refugee being humanity’s hope is all that is needed to establish Cuarón’s feelings on anti-immigration policies.

                                    <p>The viewer should insert his or her own meaning in order to arrive at a complete understanding of Kee’s and Theo’s journey. Jasper sums up the major forces in Theo’s life saying, “You’ve got faith over here and chance over there.” But it’s uncertain whether Kee’s midwife Miriam is correct when she claims, “Everything happens for a reason.” A sign that something is leading Theo to escort Kee is the friendliness of animals and how they refuse to harm him. The animals Theo interacts with seem to be more on his side than they are with the rebels. Constantly we see dogs and cats giving friendly greetings to Theo, and a rebel even remarks that the animals are never this affectionate. Even when the rebels try to attack Theo as he escapes with Kee, the dogs make no attempt to hurt him. Although underplayed, the pets’ affection indicates that Theo belongs and has a duty to fulfill. However, a viewer who didn’t interpret Theo’s journey as being guided by fate could criticize the pets’ affection as being too small and insignificant of a detail to use as the only evidence for such a broad claim.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>	Overall, and specifically in the resolution of the film, viewers decide their own meaning. Theo dies in a rowboat next to Kee and her daughter as the Human Project’s boat, “Tomorrow,” nears them in a misty fog. If a viewer believes fate and divine will brought them to this conclusion then Theo’s sacrifice was part of his redemption. After the death of his son Dylan, Theo became a cynical mid-level government official who pours liquor into his morning coffee. One link between Kee and Dylan is that, according to Jasper, they would have been about the same age if Dylan didn’t die from the flu pandemic when he was a child. Moreover, in the end Kee names her baby Dylan. Theo and his son will live through the world’s future generation. But the conclusion of the film is not entirely clear. There is enough evidence between the tiny, easily missable rowboat and the heaviness of the fog to deduce that “Tomorrow” never finds Kee. Thus the whole quest was for nothing; it was by chance and inconsequential. The stark contrast in fair interpretations of the film reflects its richness. In a way Children of Men acts a Rorschach test; the viewers must impose their judgments on the film to attain a whole, coherent meaning. This test will reveal characteristics about the viewer, whether he/she tends to lean towards faith or chance. The ambiguity in this film is why there’s so much conversation and deliberation over it. Children of Men leaves gaps instead of revealing the entire story and engages viewers by demanding them to derive their own meaning.</p>
